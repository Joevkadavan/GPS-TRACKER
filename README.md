Hi I'm Joe V Kadavan 
Built a Real-Time Hospital Locator and Navigation System and submitted to IEEERAS VIT CHENNAI 
I've been working on a web-based platform that helps users locate nearby hospitals quickly and get the shortest route from any selected starting point. Unlike Google Maps, which serves a broad range of purposes, this tool is focused solely on hospitals-making it faster and more relevant during critical situations.

It's simple, easy to use, and especially useful in emergencies where time and clarity matter most.

Here's the live project:

I'm genuinely open to collaborating with others-whether you're into design, data, development, or just have a cool idea to add on. Let's connect, share feedback, and build things that matter.
